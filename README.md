# spectral_methods_for_pdes

The repository contains a few examples of python implementations to solve partial differential equations. The considered cases are:
- Advection diffusion equation in 1d.
- Advection diffusion equation in 2d.
- Korteweg-de-Vries equation in 2d (contains a non-linear term).
